Each central processing unit (CPU) consist of arithmetic-logic unit (ALU) which is responsible for performing the arithmetic and logical operations on the computer instruction’s operands. So, the ALU has the ability of calculating mathematical equations, making logical comparisons, and putting the output results in a storage register. The ALU is divided into two units in some processors. One of them is an arithmetic unit (AU) only and the other is a logic unit (LU). The ALU has direct access to the processor controller, main memory, and input/output devices The ALU includes like internal storage to store input operands, operands that are being added, and the results of that operation. The ALU is an important part of the processor. Therefore, there are many approaches are developed to enhance the performance of handling instructions process.Each central processing unit (CPU) consist of arithmetic-logic unit (ALU) which is responsible for performing the arithmetic and logical operations on the computer instruction’s operands.
